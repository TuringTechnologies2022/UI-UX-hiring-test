# UI/UX Test
This test is a part of our hiring process at TuringTech for the UI/UX position. It should take you between 4 to 6 hours, depending on your experience, to create designs on XD/Figma/Sketch and record Loom videos. 

We also thought about a few bonus tasks, so feel free to spend some time on them if you want. Your attempt on the bonus task(s) may become a factor in your offer letter and compensation offered.

## Task:
You are a UI/UX at AllBirds. Since the launch of the new website, your team is seeing a higher rate of cart abandonments and users dropping off after visiting the product page. The marketing team is coming up with ingenious ways to drive traffic to the website however users are dropping off without purchasing.

To solve this problem, the company has hired a consultant/e-commerce expert to give you (as the UI/UX designer) feedback on what can be improved on the website to increase conversion rate (or reduce abandonment rate).

Feedback from the consultant needs to be converted into design with actionable items for the developers to avoid marketing $$$ from getting wasted. However, the suggestions that you choose to ignore need to be explained with reasoning.

Remember the goal is to increase conversion so the marketing budget is not getting wasted. 

**Tip: You need to first convert the product page on AllBirds into XD/Figma and then make changes to it based on the feedback from the consultant.**

The developers are also located remotely hence your design files, video instructions and prototype video needs to be clear to avoid any confusions.

## Bonus:
- Mobile responsive designs for Web (1280 px) and Mobile (375 px)
- Create a designer-to-developer handoff document 
- Create a prototype video (with animations) which would help explain the user flow to the developer.
